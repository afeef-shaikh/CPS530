          Mozambique has a long and complex history that dates back to ancient
          times. It was colonized by the Portuguese in the early 16th century
          and gained independence in 1975 after a prolonged struggle for
          liberation. Since then, Mozambique has faced challenges including
          civil war, but it has made significant progress in recent decades
          towards peace and development.
