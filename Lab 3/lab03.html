      <h2>Comparison Between Pure CSS and Bootstrap Implementations</h2>
      <p>
        The main difference between using pure CSS with media queries and using
        Bootstrap is the level of control and simplicity. In the pure CSS
        version, I had full control over breakpoints and could tailor every
        element exactly how I wanted. However, it took much longer to set up and
        required more careful planning, especially with fluid grids and
        positioning.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, the Bootstrap framework simplified a lot of the
        tasks, especially with its built-in grid system and pre-defined
        components. While it was faster to implement, it offers less flexibility
        compared to the custom CSS approach. Overall, I found Bootstrap easier
        for rapid development, but pure CSS gave more precision.
