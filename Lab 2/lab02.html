          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hello, I'm <strong><mark>Afeef Shaikh</mark></strong
            >, a student at Toronto Metropolitan University majoring in Business
            Technology Management with a minor in Computer Science. My
            fascination with technology began at a young age when I first
            discovered how powerful coding could be in transforming ideas into
            real-world solutions. Since then, I've been driven by a passion for
            AI/ML and its potential to revolutionize industries and improve
            lives.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over the years, I've honed my skills through various hackathons and
            projects, particularly in AI-based solutions. I strongly believe in
            using AI to tackle complex, real-world problems, which has led me to
            develop innovative applications in fields like education and
            healthcare. Whether it‚Äôs building a chatbot that enhances learning
            or creating an AI-driven support system for patients, my goal is to
            create impactful solutions that make a difference.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm also deeply invested in my continuous learning journey. I enjoy
            exploring new technologies, staying updated on industry trends, and
            constantly challenging myself with new projects. My coursework and
            hands-on experiences have equipped me with strong problem-solving
            skills, an analytical mindset, and the ability to adapt to new
            challenges in the fast-evolving tech landscape.
